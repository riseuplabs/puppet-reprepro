<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is the Debian package repository of <%= @origin %>. It is used for internal
distribution of locally built packages not yet part of Debian. Feel free to use
it for yourself, but it comes at no warranty.

<h1>How to use</h1>

<p>In your /etc/apt/source.list:

<pre>
deb http://debian.<%= @domain %>/debian lenny main
deb-src http://debian.<%= @domain %>/debian lenny main
</pre>

"lenny", of course, can be replaced by your distribution. Know that we usually
package straight for etch or lenny. Packages will likely not be available in
squeeze or sid.</p>

<h2>Adding the archive key to your keyring</h2>

<p>This archive self-signs packages uploaded to it (and packages uploaded are
verified against a whitelist of trusted uploaders) using OpenPGP (GnuPG, to be
more precise).</p>

<p>The key of the archive is in the <a href="/debian/key.asc">key.asc file</a>. You should add the key using something like this:</p>

<pre>
wget http://debian.<%= @domain %>/debian/key.asc
apt-key add key.asc
apt-get update
</pre>

<h2>Browsing the archive</h2>

There is no interactive interface to browse the archive.

<ul>
<li>To see the list of all packages regardless of the distribution, see the <a href="/debian/pool">pool directory</a></li>
<li>To see the package descriptions per distribution, see the <a href="/debian/dists">dists directory</a>
</li>
