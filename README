Reprepro module for Puppet
==========================

This module allows you to create a reprepro install easily. It can
configure cron or a inotify daemon to process the incoming queue and
takes care of configuration, user creation and so on.

Upgrading from previous versions
================================

Older version were using a single monolithic class with global
variables. We are now using a parametrized class instead, so you need
to port your manifests.

Instead of:

  $reprepro_origin = 'example.com'
  include reprepro

... you should use:

  class { 'reprepro': origin => 'example.com }

Parameters
==========

manage_distributions_conf, manage_incoming_conf
-----------------------------------------------

If true, the content of -respectively- the conf/distributions and
conf/incoming files is managed by this module. Else, only the
existence, ownership and permissions are.

Default: true.

basedir_mode
------------

This module manages the reprepro base directory and sets its
permissions to `basedir_mode`.

Default: 0771

incoming_mode
-------------

This module manages the reprepro incoming directory and sets its
permissions to `incoming_mode`.

Default: 1777
